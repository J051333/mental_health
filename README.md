# Breathe

## An app with tools devoted to mental health.

This is a small passion project of mine. As someone who struggles with their mental health, I wanted to create an app I could use to vent, control my anxiety through breathing, and keep track of my mental state.

It's written in flutter (and thus Dart) and is being tested on my Pixel 4a. I'm unsure when the first release will be as my schedule for working on this is completely arbitrary.
